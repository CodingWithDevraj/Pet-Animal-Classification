# Pet Animal Classification

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classifier that identifies pet animals—specifically *cats, **dogs, and **snakes*—from input images.

## Project Overview

Using TensorFlow and Keras, we trained a deep learning model to distinguish between three classes of pet animals. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and can be used for real-time or batch image predictions.
